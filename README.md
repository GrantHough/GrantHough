# Hey, I'm Grant Hough.

- I'm 16 years old and I currently attend Saratoga High School.
- I'm a full-stack developer with interest in machine learning. 
- I have experience with mobile apps, browser extensions, websites, and more.
- Outside of CS, I'm a percussionist who marched with The Blue Devils 'B' Drum and Bugle Corps.
- I'm also developing and teaching an [AI web app class](https://zerotoai.org) at the Saratoga Library this summer!
- If you're interested in my projects, take a look at my [website](https://granthough.me/).
