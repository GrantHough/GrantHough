# Hey, I'm Grant Hough.

- I'm currently a senior at Saratoga High School.
- I'm a full-stack developer with interest in machine learning. 
- I have experience with mobile apps, browser extensions, websites, and more.
- Outside of CS, I'm a percussionist who marched with The Blue Devils 'B' Drum and Bugle Corps.
