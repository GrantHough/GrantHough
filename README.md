### Hey, I'm Grant Hough.

## I'm 15 years old and I currently attend Saratoga High School.
# My somewhat recent focus is in the field of Machine Learning, but I've also been continuing my journey in iOS app development. Outside of CS, I'm a percussionist who will be marching with The Blue Devils 'B' Drum and Bugle Corps.

# If you're interested in my projects, take a look at my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/grant-l-hough?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav).
