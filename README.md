# Hey, I'm Grant Hough.

- I'm 15 years old and I currently attend Saratoga High School.
- I'm a full-stack developer with interest in machine learning. 
- I have experience creating iOS apps and am currently exploring the implementation of PyTorch/TensorFlow models in iOS apps in order to take advantage of mobile-specific features
- Outside of CS, I'm a percussionist who will be marching with The Blue Devils 'B' Drum and Bugle Corps.
- If you're interested in my projects, take a look at my [Devpost](https://devpost.com/grant-l-hough?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav).
